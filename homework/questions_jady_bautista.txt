4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
An old friend and I were messing around in class and pretending do homework and we were talking about something personal to her life that didn't need to be shared with the others. And we wrote down a list on a google doc that also had the same name as my homework and I accidentally turned that in instead of the actual homework. 2 weeks later I got sent to the principal's office and I wasn't sure what it was for and I almost got expelled.
5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
